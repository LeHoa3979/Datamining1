# Diabetes Prediction using R & Weka  

## ðŸ“Œ Introduction  
This project applies data mining techniques to predict diabetes based on patient datasets. The model is developed using **R** and **Weka**, leveraging Machine Learning algorithms for classification.  

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure  
- `train.arff` - Training dataset  
- `predict.arff` - Dataset for prediction  
- `script.R` - R script for data processing and modeling  
- `README.md` - Project documentation  

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used  
- **R**: Data preprocessing, model training  
- **Weka**: Machine Learning model implementation  
- **ARFF**: File format used for Weka datasets  

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project  
1. Open Weka and load the `train.arff` file  
2. Select a Machine Learning algorithm to train the model  
3. Load the `predict.arff` file to make predictions  
4. If using R, run `script.R` for automated processing  

## ðŸ“Š Expected Results  
This project aims to enhance diabetes prediction accuracy and support healthcare data analysis.  

## ðŸ“œ Dataset Source  
- The dataset is sourced from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) or other open data sources.
